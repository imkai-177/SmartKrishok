# SmartKrishok

## Project Overview

SmartKrishok is a mobile-based agricultural platform developed as part of a Software Engineering course project. The main purpose of this project is to support farmers in Bangladesh by providing easy access to reliable agricultural information, real-time weather updates, expert consultation services, and a digital marketplace.

The project focuses on reducing farmers’ dependence on unreliable sources of information and helping them make better farming decisions through technology.

## Problem Statement

Most farmers in Bangladesh still rely on traditional farming methods and informal advice from local traders or neighbors. Due to the lack of timely information about weather changes, crop diseases, and market prices, farmers often face production losses and financial difficulties.

SmartKrishok aims to address this problem by introducing a centralized digital platform that delivers accurate, real-time, and localized agricultural services in Bangla.

## Proposed Solution

SmartKrishok provides an integrated system where farmers can:

- Learn modern farming techniques
- Receive real-time weather forecasts
- Consult certified agricultural experts
- Buy and sell agricultural tools and products
- Track live market prices
- Interact with other farmers through a Q&A community

The system is designed with a simple and user-friendly interface so that farmers with limited digital literacy can use it easily.
